# Introduction

## Main Research Question

- What instances characteristics of optimisation problems make them predisposed to being solved on a Quantum Computer?

# Background

## Quantum Bits (Qubits)

>- In normal computation, bits have a *state* which is either 0 or 1. Similarly in qubits, states are either $\ket{0}$ or $\ket{1}$. In Linear Algebra we may represent the states as follows:

>- $$
\ket{0} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \qquad \text{and} \qquad \ket{1} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\  1 \end{pmatrix}
$$

>- A single qubit may be represented by as follows:

>- $$
  \ket{\psi} = \alpha \ket{0} +  \beta \ket{1} \qquad \text{where} \enspace \alpha,\beta \in \mathbb{C}
$$

>- Also, $|\alpha|^2$ and $|\beta|^2$ correspond to the probability associated with measuring either $\ket{0}$ or $\ket{1}$,

## Quantum Bits (Qubits)

>- The state $$\ket{+} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{0} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{1}$$
>- This state corresponds to a 50% chance of being in  $\ket{0}$ or $\ket{1}$ as $\alpha^2 = \beta^2=0.5$

## Extending to More Qubits

>- Classically for **2-bit** system we have 4 possible bits $00$, $01$, $10$ and $11$.
>- In quantum computing these can be specified as the following: $\ket{00}$, $\ket{01}$, $\ket{10}$, $\ket{11}$. Using Linear Algebra the state can be represented by a vector of length $2^2=4$. For example:

>- $$
\ket{00} = \begin{pmatrix}1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \quad \text{also,} \sum_{x \in \{0,1\}^2}|\alpha_x|^2 = 1
$$
>- The state $\ket{\psi} = \frac{1}{2}\ket{00} + \frac{1}{2}\ket{01} + \frac{1}{2}\ket{10} + \frac{1}{2}\ket{11}$ corresponds to an equal likelhood of being any of the basis states.
>- To extend this framework to $n$ qubits, we must represent that state by a $2^n$ vector. A shorthand notation has been developed where $\ket{0}^{\otimes2}$ corresponds to the state $\ket{00}$

## Adiabatic Quantum Computing (AQC)

>- Adiabatic Quantum Computation is a computational model which relies on the *adiabatic thereom* of quantum mechanics to compute calculations.
>- The famous *SchrÃ¶dinger Equation* is well-known to describe the time evolution of a quantum state:

>- $$
i\hbar \frac{d}{dt} \ket{\psi (t)} = H(t) \ket{\psi{t}}
$$

>- $\ket{\psi(t)}$ is our state vector, $H(t)$ is the time dependent Hamiltonian. A Hamiltonian of an $n$-qubit system $H(t)$ is given by  $2^n \times 2^n$ matrix.

## Adiabatic Quantum Computing (AQC)

>- An adiabatic computation can be expressed by specifying two Hamiltonians, denoted by $H_B$ and $H_P$ where $H_B$ is our *initial* Hamiltonian and $H_P$ is the *final* or *problem* Hamiltonian.
>- $$\begin{matrix}
  H_B &  \xrightarrow{\hspace*{3cm}} & H_P \\
\ket{\psi_B} &  \text{transform } H(t) &  \ket{\psi_P} \\ 
\text{known state} &  &  \text{unknown}
\end{matrix}
$$
>- Loosely speaking, the adiabatic theorem tells us that if we vary from $H_B$ to $H_P$ *slowly enough* the system will remain in its ground state. This fact is a direct result of the Adiabatic Theorem.


## Adiabatic Quantum Computing (AQC)

>- To conduct the computation we evolve $\ket{\psi(t)}$ till time $t=T$ such that $\ket{\psi(t=T)}$ encodes the answer. The computation is done using a Hamiltonian which linearly interpolates between $H_B$ and $H_P$. Specifically as below:

>- $$
H(t) = \left(1 - \frac{t}{T}\right)H_B + \frac{t}{T}H_P
$$
>- How fast? 
>- $$
 T =  \frac{1}{\min_t  g(t)^2}
$$
>- Where $g(t)$ is the difference between the first two smallest eigenvalues of $H(t)$


## 3SAT (Exact Cover)

>- The satisfiability problem, abbreviated SAT, is a classic example of an NP-complete problem [@Cook1971]
>- The basic SAT formulation can be described as follows: Given a boolean formula (AND $\land$, OR $\lor$ , NOT $\neg$) over $n$ variables ($z_1, z_2, ... , z_n$). Can one set $z_i$'s in a manner such that the Boolean formula is true?
>- A clause is an expression which the variables must satisfy. For example $z_1 \land z_2 \implies z_1 = z_2 = 1$


## 3SAT (Exact Cover Example)

>- Consider a 3-bit number with two clauses:
>    - $z_1 + z_2 = 1$
>    - $z_1 + z_3 = 1$
>- Here we have 8 possible assignments, namely $\{000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111\}$
>- However, our **satisfying assignments** are $z_1 = 1, z_2 = 0, z_3 = 0$ or $z_1 = 0, z_2 = 1, z_3 =1$
>- The 3-SAT problem in particular is a problem where each clause is comprised of 3 literals.

## Mapping 3SAT to AQC

>- How do we construct $H_B$ and $H_P$ so that we can solve our optimisation problem?

## Mapping 3SAT to AQC ($H_B$)

>- We initialise our system in a state that is easy to prepare:

>- $$
	\ket{\psi} = \ket{z_1} \ket{ z_2} \dots \ket{ z_n}
$$

>- We couple a magnetic field in the $x-$direction to each qubit. Resulting in the following ground state for $H_B$:

>- $$
 \ket{\psi_g(T=0)} = \frac{1}{2^{n/2}}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\ket{z_1} \ket{ z_2} \dots \ket{ z_n}
$$

>- This ground state corresponds to a uniform superposition across all possible qubit assignments.

## Mapping 3SAT to AQC ($H_B$)

>- Mathematically speaking, if we wish to apply an $x$ rotation on the 1st qubit. We define the following Hamiltonian:
>- $$
	H_B^{1} = \sigma^X_1 = X^{(1)} \otimes I^{(2)} \otimes I^{(3)} \ldots \otimes I^{(n)}, \qquad X= \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0\end{pmatrix}, \enspace I = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1\end{pmatrix}
$$
>- This Hamiltonian is of dimensions $2^n \times 2^n$
>- Thus, our initial Hamiltonian is given by:
>- $$
	H_B = \sum_{i=1}^{n} H_B^{i} \enspace, \quad H_B^{i} = \frac{1}{2}\left(1 - \sigma^{X}_{i}\right), \quad \text{where} \enspace\dim(H_B) = 2^n \times 2^n
$$
>- *Note:* We have applied a normalisation here.

## Mapping 3SAT to AQC ($H_P$)

>- Recall, $H_P$ must be constructed such that it encodes the solution. Thus we prepare a Hamiltonian, whose lowest energy state corresponds to a state vector containing our solution.
>- Let's suppose we have a clause $C$ which involves the three bits $i_C$, $j_C$ and $k_C$, and we define the following energy function:
>- $$
h_C (z_{i_C}, z_{j_C}, z_{k_C}) = \begin{cases} 0 \qquad &\text{if $i_C$, $j_C$, $k_C$ satisfy $C$} \\ 1 \qquad & \text{if not satisfied} \end{cases}
$$
>- Now we let,
>- $$
H_P^{C} \ket{z_1} \dots \ket{z_n} = h_C (z_{i_C}, z_{j_C}, z_{k_C})\ket{z_1} \dots \ket{z_n}
$$

## Mapping 3SAT to AQC ($H_P$)

>- Finally we express our problem Hamiltonian as follows:
>- $$
H_P = \sum_{C} H^C_P
$$
>- We then evolve our system with the following interpolation:
>- $$
H(t) = \left(1 - \frac{t}{T}\right)H_B + \frac{t}{T}H_P
$$
>- Finally, complete measurement

## Proposed Research

>- Depending on different structures of instances, classical algorithms may perform differently to Quantum ones.
>- We are looking to investigate which types of instances are more pre-disposed to being solved on Quantum Computers:
>- To do this we will simulate AQC and measure the "quantum-ness" of each instance:
>    1. Minimum Energy Gap $g_{\text{min}}$
>    2. Maximum Entropy of Entanglement

## Proposed Research

>- This will involve large amounts of generating experimental data
>- To survey the instances we will deploy the instance space analysis methodology
>- Ultimately, we can build a prediction model which maps instance features of different 3SAT instances to their inherent "Quantumness"

## Proposed Research

>- Given that we have access to IBM's Quantum Computer, we may also apply a discretized version of AQC and produce results from a *real quantum computer*
>- This methodology can then be further extended to other optmisation problems such as Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimisation (QUBO)
>- More ideas likely to come...
